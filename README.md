# Top Down Shooter

This is my new project idea. I realized I was struggling with Django, so I decided to make a last-minute change and create a video game.

The game is a top-down tile-based shooter boss battle. Tiles include floor, wall, water, and bomb, though they are not programmed yet.

Sources are currently in the python file and below.

# Progress Report

(April) So far, I have not been able to figure out why my pip was not being seen by python.

(April) I have managed to resolve the issue by uninstalling Python, removing all Python files in AppData, and then reinstalling Python 64-bit. Then, I followed https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/ to check if pip is installed. I have also installed Django.

(April) I installed Django and virtualenv, as well as a new directory for the project, though I am still trying to figure out where to go from here. Right now, when I try to turn on the virtualenv, I get something that says "'virtualenv' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." On the part that says "Creating a Project in Django" in the book (page 400)

(April 20-ish) I searched for a guide to integrate an image into Django, though I couldn't find anything.

(May 3) Realized I was struggling with Django and was making literally no progress, so I just changed the project. I think Django isn't the right program for what I wanted to do (which probably would have been easier on HTML)

(May 11) I have committed to making a top-down shooter in the vein of "Realm of the Mad God" or something like that. Since I don't have a lot of time left, I need to allocate time this weekend and before the presentation next week. So far I have the map assets (look in the "topdown" folder).

(May 13) I managed to get somewhat far, as I have created a world and added sprites for a player and a boss. However, I couldn't make the player move. The sprites were created using classes.
